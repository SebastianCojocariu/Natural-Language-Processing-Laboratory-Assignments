Colab notebooks allow you to combine executable code and rich text in a single document, along with images, HTML, LaTeX and more. 
When you create your own Colab notebooks, they are stored in your Google Drive account. 
You can easily share your Colab notebooks with co-workers or friends, allowing them to comment on your notebooks or even edit them.
